	I’m a senior and the feature editor of The Olympian. I like to write about technology and equality, and everything that intersects between the two. My app Upstream: Combat Climate Change is out on the App Store now. It’s a game designed to inspire positive environmental impact. I’m a participant in Girls Who Code, a president of Girls Learn International, and avid programmer and activist. Last year, I designed this staff page--I hope you like it as much as I like my dog! Please enjoy our newspaper and let it provoke interesting thoughts.

	<div class="bio">I am a junior and love devoting my time to serving the community. I can understand both Mandarin and Cantonese, but I can’t speak them fluently. I am involved with Interact and Red Cross; both community service clubs at our school. In addition to volunteering, I also enjoy planning our student activities as I am one of the Junior Class officers in our leadership class. This will be my first year being apart of The Olympian and I am looking forward to many learning new things.

	<div class="bio">I am a junior and participate in music and sports for the school. I play trumpet and piano, so I like to write about the entertainment in music that goes on in CVHS. I also play soccer and enjoy writing about sports. Over the summer I participated in an internship with a local veterinary hospital and a music camp to stay busy while out of school.
